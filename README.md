## Cat Café
Cat Café is an app which encourages students to study with the formation of virtual study groups. In doing so, they are able to learn together in a safe manner while motivating each other through the fun interface of our application. COVID-19 greatly limits face-to-face education and interaction and that was a problem we wanted to tackle mainly since, with the lack of a proper study environment, students can often lose motivation in their studies.
